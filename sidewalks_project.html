          The efficiency and sustainability of urban planning and operations can have a major
          impact on meeting sustainability goals. To take a step forward in this diretion which enables us to make useful applications for urban planning we built a sidewalk network given any road network. Multiple applications can be built on top of these sidewalk networks. Several different pedestrian connectivity settings will be explored, capturing both targeted planning such as providing connectivity for walking to school, as well as pedestrian connectivity designs with more general walkability measures. Find more on each of these projects below.

          <p>
            This project provides an API that converts any given road network shapefile to a sidewalk network osm or shapefile. This network can used as a base for multiple applications related to urban connectivity and planning. To learn more

          <h4>Pedestrian Connectivity</h4>
          <p>
            This project uses network analysis algorithms to provide pedestrian connectivity given a certain radius. It also enables users to select different sidewalks that they want connected and constructs the new improved connectivity graph on the fly.To learn more

          <h4>Walk to School Network Design</h4>
          <p>This project provides different paths (consiting of mostly sidewalk edges and minimum road edges) for a child to get from home to school and vice versa. To learn more <a href = "#">Click Here</a></p>

          <h4>Resource Planning for Sidewalks</h4>
          <p>This project enables resource planners to make informed decisions on allocating funds to sidewalk constrution and maintainence by taking into account different features about each sidewalk and assigning a weight to each of them.To learn more <a href = "#">Click Here</a></p>
